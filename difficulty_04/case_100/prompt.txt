Create a Terraform configuration to set up an AWS IAM role (demo_eks) for an Amazon EKS cluster. The role should allow assuming roles for EKS services and have policies attached for AmazonEKSClusterPolicy and AmazonEKSVPCResourceController. Also, create an AWS EKS cluster (demo_eks) with specified VPC configurations. Ensure proper dependency handling for IAM role permissions during cluster management.
