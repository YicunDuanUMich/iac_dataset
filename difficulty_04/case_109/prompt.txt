Create an AWS S3 bucket named 'wellcomecollection-platform-infra' with preventive destruction measures. Set the bucket ACL to 'private' and configure a lifecycle policy for automatic deletion of objects with a 'tmp/' prefix after 30 days. Implement versioning and set up lifecycle rules to transition old versions to the 'STANDARD_IA' storage class after 30 days and delete noncurrent versions after 90 days.
