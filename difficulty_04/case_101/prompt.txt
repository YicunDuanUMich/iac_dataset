The role should allow assuming roles for EKS services and have the AmazonEKSClusterPolicy attached. Additionally, create an AWS EKS cluster with the name "demo" and configure its VPC with specified subnet IDs from in the us-east-1 region. Ensure dependency handling for the IAM role's policy attachment during EKS cluster management.
