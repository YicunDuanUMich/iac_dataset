An API Gateway Rest API named "caas" that has a resource endpoint named "caas_cat" with a path_part "cat" linking to two methods "caas_get" and "caas_put" with http_method "GET" and "PUT." Each of the methods should have a corresponding Lambda function that the API Gateway will have permission to access. A S3 bucket that stores cat pictures which will be accessed by a Lambda function, and a DynamoDB table with one keyed attribute, strings "name" of the cat.
