Using route 53 resources, configure a weighted routing policy that splits users between three db_instances that are replicas of a main db_instance. Provision the three replica instances in "us-east-1", "eu-central-1", and "ap-southeast-1". Provision the zone and main db_instance in "us-west-1". Call the zone "main", the original db_instance "primary", the three replicas "replica_us_east", "replica_eu_central" and "replica_ap_southeast" respectively, and the provider aliases "main", "us-east", "eu-central", and "ap-southeast".
