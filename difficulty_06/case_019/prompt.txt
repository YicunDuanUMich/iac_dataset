Configure an AWS VPC with internet gateway, two public subnets, a security group, and a route table associated with the public subnets. Then connect these resources to two Elastic Beanstalk environments. These environments are also connected to a shared RDS database that is linked to the subnets. Name the database "shared_rds", the security group "eb_env_sg", the vpc "eb_vpc", and the subnets "eb_subnet_public_1" and "eb_subnet_public_2"
