Generate a Terraform configuration for creating an AWS S3 bucket and setting its ownership controls. Define a resource for an S3 bucket with a specified name. Follow this by configuring ownership controls for this bucket, referencing its ID. Within the ownership controls, set a rule to specify the object ownership as 'BucketOwnerPreferred'. Ensure that the resources are properly linked using references, and the configuration is clearly laid out to reflect these settings.
