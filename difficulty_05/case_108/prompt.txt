Set up an AWS S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for Terraform state management. Specify variables for the AWS region, S3 bucket name for state storage, and DynamoDB table name for locks. Ensure the S3 bucket has preventive measures against accidental deletion and is configured with versioning enabled, server-side encryption using AES256, and public access restrictions. Create a DynamoDB table with a hash key named 'LockID' using 'PAY_PER_REQUEST' billing mode for Terraform locking.
