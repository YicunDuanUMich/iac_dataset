Create a Terraform script for an AWS EKS setup with pod identity management. Start by defining an IAM policy document (called "example") for assuming a role by EKS pods. Then, create an IAM role (called "example") using this policy. Attach a policy for S3 read-only access to this role. Finally, define an EKS pod identity association linking the role to a specific EKS cluster (called "example"), namespace, and service account.
