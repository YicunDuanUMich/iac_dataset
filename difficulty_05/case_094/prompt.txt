Create a Terraform script for provisioning an AWS EKS cluster with name "example". Define a resource with the cluster's name and associated IAM role ARN. Configure the VPC settings with specific subnet IDs. Include dependencies on IAM role policy attachments for proper resource management during creation and deletion. Finally, add outputs for the cluster's endpoint and the kubeconfig certificate authority data.
