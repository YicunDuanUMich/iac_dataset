Create an AWS S3 bucket for CloudGoat data storage, with a dynamic bucket name incorporating the bucket_suffix "test" from a variable. Configure the bucket with private ACLs and ownership controls for ObjectWriter access. Set up another S3 bucket for web data storage with a similar dynamic name. Upload an object 'order_data2.csv' to the web data bucket from a local file path. Implement public access block settings for the web data bucket to ignore public ACLs, block public ACLs, and restrict public buckets. Lastly, create a bucket policy allowing 's3:PutObject' action for all principals on the web data bucket's objects.
