Create an AWS S3 bucket named 'my_bucket' and define an S3 bucket policy to deny access from a specific IP address. Ensure that the S3 bucket policy includes a version number, an identifier, and a statement that denies all S3 actions for the specified IP address. Use the 'jsonencode' function to encode the policy in JSON format.
