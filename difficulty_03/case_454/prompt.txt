establishes a VPC peering connection between two AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). The first VPC name is "peer," and the second VPC name is "base". The peering connection, named "pike," connects these two VPCs, allowing them to communicate with each other as if they were in the same network, and is tagged with pike = "permissions" to indicate its purpose or management policy.
