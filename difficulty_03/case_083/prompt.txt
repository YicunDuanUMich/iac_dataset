Configure a health check with route 53 that uses a cloudwatch metric alarm called "foobar". Set the metric_name to "CPUUtilization", namespace to "AWS/EC2", statistic to "Average", period to "120", and comparison_operator to "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold". If the health check doesn't have enough info about the alarm, the status should be "Healthy". All resources should be provisioned in "us-east-1"
