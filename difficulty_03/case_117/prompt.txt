Create an IAM policy document that allows the 's3.amazonaws.com' service to publish to an SNS topic for S3 event notifications. Specify the actions as 'SNS:Publish' and set the resource to the ARN of the SNS topic 's3-event-notification-topic'. Apply a condition to allow this action only if the source ARN is similar to the ARN of the specified S3 bucket. Create an SNS topic named 's3-event-notification-topic' with the generated IAM policy. Set up an S3 bucket named 'your-bucket-name' and configure it to send notifications to the SNS topic for 's3:ObjectCreated:*' events with a filter for '.log' suffix.
